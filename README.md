# ‚è∞ ScheduleClout
ScheduleClout is a chrome extension that adds the scheduling functionality to BitClout.

## Installation
Currently, you can install the extension manually by following the **Build Guide** below; however, we are planning to publish the extension on Google Chrome Web Store.

## System Requirements
- Properly configured GIT
- An active internet connection
- NodeJS (v10+), NPM, and NPX
- A chromium-based browser

## Build Guide
1. Clone the repository by running the following command:
    ```shell script
    git clone https://github.com/ScheduleClout/Extension.git 
    ```
1. Install the project dependencies
    ```shell script
    npm install
    ```
1. Build the project by running either of the following commands:
    ```shell script
   npm run build
    ```
   or
   ```shell script
    npx webpack --config webpack.config.js --mode production
    ```
## Manual Installation
We assumed you are running on Google Chrome. Depending on your browser, this process might be slightly different.

1. Head over to `chrome://extensions`
1. Enable `Developer Mode` by clicking on the toggle button on the top right corner of the screen.
1. Three new buttons will appear under the header. Click on `Load Unpacked` to trigger the folder selection modal.
1. Locate the `/dist` folder inside the appropriate folder, and click on `Select` or `Open`.

## Known Issues and Possible Improvements
1. The extension uses chrome's alarm API to handle its task; therefore, if for any reason the alarm API doesn't fire, the scheduler will not work.
1. While posting a scheduled content, the extension opens a new browser window to sign the transaction and prevent CloudFlare's Human Verification. So, if the page fails to load, the extension cannot publish the post. Currently, the extension will not retry these cases. 
1. The extension doesn't show any indicators while doing its job.
